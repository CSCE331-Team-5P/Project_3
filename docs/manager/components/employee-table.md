## File: `src/components/EmployeeTable.jsx`
- **Purpose:** Provides a table component for displaying, filtering, adding, and removing employees, with support for dynamic data and filtering options.
- **Props:** None directly, but the component manages its own state for employee data and filters.
- **Functions:**
  - **EmployeeTable Component:**
    - **Purpose:** Main component for managing employee data with features like filtering, adding, and soft-removing employees.
    - **State Management:**
      - Tracks employee data (`employees`), new employee details (`newEmployee`), and filter values (`filters`).
    - **Effect Hook:**
      - Fetches initial employee data from the backend on component mount using the `/api/employee` endpoint.
  - **handleInputChange:**
    - **Purpose:** Updates state values for new employee fields based on user input.
  - **handleFilterChange:**
    - **Purpose:** Updates state values for filter fields based on user input.
  - **addEmployee:**
    - **Purpose:** Sends a POST request to the backend to add a new employee, updates the state with the new employee, and resets the input fields.
    - **Error Handling:** Alerts the user if any required field is missing or if the backend request fails.
  - **removeEmployee:**
    - **Purpose:** Sends a PATCH request to soft-remove an employee (updates status to "Inactive") and updates the UI accordingly.
    - **Error Handling:** Alerts the user if the backend request fails.
  - **filteredEmployees:**
    - **Purpose:** A `useMemo` hook that dynamically filters employees based on the `name`, `job`, and `status` fields.

- **Features:**
  - **Dynamic Employee List:**
    - Displays a list of employees with attributes like ID, name, job, wage, and status.
    - Updates dynamically when employees are added or removed.
  - **Filtering:**
    - Provides filter fields for `name`, `job`, and `status`, allowing real-time search.
  - **Form for Adding Employees:**
    - Includes fields for first name, last name, birthdate, job, hourly wage, and status.
    - Validates all required fields before allowing submission.
  - **Soft Removal:**
    - Allows employees to be marked as "Inactive" instead of being fully deleted.
  - **Responsive Table:**
    - Displays employee data in a structured table with headers, rows, and actions for each employee.
  - **Reusable Components:**
    - Utilizes shared UI components like `Table`, `Button`, `Input`, and `Label` for consistency.
  - **Error Handling:**
    - Alerts the user for missing fields during addition or backend errors during API calls.
